Tropic Thunder

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
Iceland. They have cool things like glaciers, mountains, and volcanoes.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Telekinesis, because I could grab things without having to get up.
I could also throw something, and it would always hit my target
